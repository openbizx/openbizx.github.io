## Like what you see? Yeoman can do more.

Yeoman supports scaffolding out a lot more for Angular and other frameworks than what we’ve shown today.

For example, the Angular generator also supports creating new views, directives and controllers for you. A new controller can be scaffolded by running `yo angular:route routeName`, which will create your controller files but also update the route in *app.js* for you. We also try scaffolding out unit tests where possible.

To find out all the Yeoman commands for the Angular generator take a look at the [generator readme](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular#readme).

## Where to go next

* **AngularJS** ([angularjs.org](https://angularjs.org/)) helped us write this Todo app quickly and with elegance. To dig deeper into the sweet spots of AngularJS, take a look at the detailed [documentation](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/overview).

* **Grunt** ([gruntjs.com](http://gruntjs.com)) has tasks for almost anything you might like to do with your app, whether it’s [compiling CoffeeScript](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-compass) or [hooking up your app to custom middleware](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-connect) like PHP or Express. Your Yeoman app already has a *Gruntfile.js* already set up for you so read up on how to configure more Grunt tasks [here](http://gruntjs.com/configuring-tasks).

* **Bower** ([bower.io](http://bower.io/)) has a growing collection of easily installable packages for adding capabilities to your app. View all the packages available through Bower's registry [here](http://sindresorhus.com/bower-components/).

* **Yeoman** is always evolving. Be sure to check out [yeoman.io](http://yeoman.io) for more information and follow [@yeoman](https://twitter.com/yeoman) and [+Yeoman](https://plus.google.com/101063139999404044459/posts) to stay up to date.

That’s it from your man-in-a-hat for now. Thanks!
